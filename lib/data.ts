  description: `I'm a Computer Science undergraduate who enjoys building real-world software systems that combine full-stack development with artificial intelligence. 

I focus on solving practical problems — from automating code reviews to developing environmental monitoring systems — and I frequently use AI-assisted development tools to accelerate productivity while maintaining a deep understanding of the underlying architecture.

I’m particularly interested in scalable backend systems, machine learning applications, and developer tooling.`,
